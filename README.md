### Description

This front end web app was built using the React framework. The app will find the faces on an image URL and draw boxes around each face in the picture.  The app has full sign in and register functionality to build a user's profile.  The profile is stored in a PostgreSQL database and may be updated and changed.  JSON Web Tokens and Redis are used for session management.  This app works in conjunction with my deployed node server via heroku.  A simple AWS Lambda function is used to assign the user an emoji badge based on how many images have been searched.

### API used

This web app uses the Clarifai face recognition API.
